Description: A set of tools to facilitate data sonification and handle the 'musicXML' format <https://usermanuals.musicxml.com/MusicXML/Content/XS-MusicXML.htm>.
    Several classes are defined for basic musical objects such as note pitch, note duration, note, measure and score. 
    Moreover, sonification utilities functions are provided, e.g. to map data into musical attributes such as pitch, loudness or duration.
    A typical sonification workflow hence looks like: get data; map them to musical attributes; create and write the 'musicXML' score, 
    which can then be further processed using specialized music software (e.g. 'MuseScore', 'GuitarPro', etc.).
    Examples can be found in the blog <https://globxblog.github.io/>, the presentation by Renard and Le Bescond (2022, <https://hal.science/hal-03710340v1>) or the poster by Renard et al. (2023, <https://hal.inrae.fr/hal-04388845v1>).
