Description: A set of tools to handle the 'musicXML' format and facilitate data sonification.
    It defines several classes for basic musical objects such as note pitch,
	note duration, note, measure and score. These objects are very similar, 
	although not always identical, to the elements defined in the 'musicXML' schema
	<https://usermanuals.musicxml.com/MusicXML/Content/XS-MusicXML.htm>.
	There are also sonification utilities functions, e.g. to map 
	data into musical attributes such as pitch, loudness or duration.
	A typical sonification workflow hence looks like:
	get data -> map them to musical attributes -> create and write 'musicXML' score.
	The resulting 'musicXML' file can then be further processed using a specialized 
	software (e.g. 'MuseScore', 'GuitarPro', etc.)
