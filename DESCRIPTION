Description: This package provides tools to handle the musicXML format.
    It defines several classes for basic musical objects such as note pitch,
	note duration, note, measure and score. These objects are very similar, 
	although not always identical, to the elements defined in the musicXML schema
	(https://usermanuals.musicxml.com/MusicXML/Content/XS-MusicXML.htm).
	There are also sonification utilities functions, e.g. to map 
	data into musical attributes such as pitch, loudness or duration.
	A typical sonification workflow hence looks like:
	get data -> map them to musical attributes -> create and write musicXML score.
	The resulting musicXML file can then be further processed using a specialized 
	software (e.g. MuseScore, GuitarPro, etc.)
